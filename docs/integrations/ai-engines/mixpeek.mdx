This guide demonstrates how to implement advanced video understanding using Mixpeek Embed with MindsDB. We'll cover indexing videos, performing text-based searches, and conducting reverse video searches.

[Mixpeek Embed](https://docs.mixpeek.com/api-documentation/inference/embed) provides powerful video understanding capabilities, allowing you to implement semantic search and analysis on video content.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

1. Install MindsDB on your system or obtain access to cloud options.
2. Install the required dependencies for Mixpeek Embed with MindsDB.
3. Obtain your Mixpeek API Key from the [Mixpeek Dashboard](https://mixpeek.com/start).

## AI Engine Setup

First, create an ML Engine using your Mixpeek API key:

```sql
CREATE ML_ENGINE mixpeek_engine
FROM mixpeek
USING
  mixpeek_api_key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';
```

## Video Indexing

To index videos, create a model that processes and embeds video content:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.mixpeek_video_index
PREDICT embeddings
USING
  engine = 'mixpeek_engine',
  task = 'indexing',
  model_id = 'vuse-generic-v1',
  video_urls = [
    'https://mixpeek-public-demo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/starter/jurassic_park_trailer.mp4'
  ],
  chunk_interval = 1,
  resolution = [720, 1280];
```

This model will process the specified video(s) into 1-second chunks and generate embeddings for each chunk.

## Text-Based Search

To perform text-based searches on the indexed videos, create a search model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.mixpeek_text_search
PREDICT search_results
USING
  engine = 'mixpeek_engine',
  task = 'search',
  model_id = 'vuse-generic-v1',
  search_query_column = 'query',
  index_model = 'mixpeek_video_index';
```

To search for video segments using text:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.mixpeek_text_search
WHERE query = 'two people inside a car';
```

This query will return video chunks that are semantically similar to the description "two people inside a car".

## Reverse Video Search

For reverse video search, create another model:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.mixpeek_reverse_video_search
PREDICT search_results
USING
  engine = 'mixpeek_engine',
  task = 'reverse_search',
  model_id = 'vuse-generic-v1',
  video_query_column = 'query_video',
  index_model = 'mixpeek_video_index';
```

To perform a reverse video search:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.mixpeek_reverse_video_search
WHERE query_video = 'https://mixpeek-public-demo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/starter/jurassic_bunny.mp4';
```

This query will return the top most similar video chunks from the indexed videos.

## Retrieving Indexed Videos

To view information about the indexed videos:

```sql
DESCRIBE mindsdb.mixpeek_video_index.indexed_videos;
```

This will display details about all processed videos, including their IDs, durations, and file information.

## Technical Insights

- **Chunking Strategy**: 1-second intervals balance precision and database size.
- **Embedding Model**: vuse-generic-v1 creates 768-dimensional embeddings capturing both visual and semantic information.
- **Cross-Modal Search**: The system supports both video and text queries against the same video database.
- **Scalability**: This approach can handle larger video databases with proper optimization.

## Practical Applications

1. Content Recommendation
2. Copyright Enforcement
3. Video Summarization
4. Educational Tools
5. Forensic Analysis
6. Content Moderation

## Conclusion

By integrating Mixpeek's video processing and embedding capabilities with MindsDB, we've created a powerful system for video indexing and semantic search. This setup enables both text-to-video and video-to-video search capabilities, opening up a wide range of applications in video analysis and retrieval.

As video content continues to grow, tools like this become increasingly valuable for managing and deriving insights from vast video repositories. The cross-modal nature of this system, allowing both video and text queries, makes it particularly versatile and suited for various use cases.
